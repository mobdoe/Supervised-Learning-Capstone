PredictedÂ online fundraising page success and recommended action steps to increase likelihood of success 
(logistic regression, random forest, boosting)

To give some more context:
So to give some context, Thirst Project is a nonprofit that builds wells in developing communities through the education and activation of young people.

Most of our student programs and fundraising initiatives relied on big events like hosting Walks 4 Water, Galas, and other in-person events.

The ongoing pandemic has flipped all our strategies on their heads. It has caused our organization to re-look at the way we activate students to fundraise for water projects. So! I chose to focus my research on the likelihood of a fundraising page hitting it's goal, given the data we've collected.

Based on certain criteria, can we predict whether a student's fundraising page will succeed? What are those factors and how do they affect that likelihood?

----
This project pulled information from all fundraising pages since 2014 (a fundraising page report & transaction report).

After running a few models (listed above), we were able to interpret our results to improve our goal-setting and strategic planning methods for students.

You can find the raw data csv files in this repo, as well as a copy of the colab notebook.

Enjoy!
