# supervised-learning
PredictedÂ online fundraising page success and recommended action steps to increase likelihood of success 
(logistic regression, random forest, boosting)

To give some more context:
Thirst Project works to build water projects in developing communities to provide access to clean water by educating and activating young people.

Most student programs relied heavily on in-person events. With COVID19, we've had to place a heavier emphasis on online fundraising.

This project pulled information from all fundraising pages since 2014 (a fundraising page report & transaction report).

After running a few models (listed above), we were able to interpret our results to improve our goal-setting and strategic planning methods for students.

You can find the raw data csv files in this repo, as well as a copy of the colab notebook.

Enjoy!
